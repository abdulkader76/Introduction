# Ternary Expressions

# ternary expressions 
# when you are choosing between 2 values based on a condition, you can write code in a concise manner using ternary expressions

# e.g of ternary expression
# value1 if condition else value2

# in the above example, Python will evaluate the condition
# it will return value1 if it's truthy
# otherwise, it will return value2

# ternary expression use the same if else statement but in a different manner

# e.g example of an 'if'
# if shape.sides() == 3:
#     print("Triangle")
# else:
#     print("Square")


# e.g following code in a ternary expression
# print("Triangle" if (shape.sides() == 3) else "Square")

# e.g ternaries are useful when dealing with invalid or missing data

# print('N/A' if value == None else value)

# use ternaries when code is clear and readable - clarity in significant

# many Python programmers do not favor ternaries, especially if they are hard to read. Use them wisely.
