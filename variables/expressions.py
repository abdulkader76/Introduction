# Expressions and Assignments

# assgn & re-assgn - use expressions on right side of =

# e.g 
# left_side = 5
# right_side = 32
# total = left_side + right_side
# print(total)


# e.g function call to compute resulting value
# def square(number):
#   return number * number

# forty_two_squared = square(42)
# print(forty_two_squared)          # 1764

# right side of assgn is evaluated
# before assgn result to variable

# e.g
# foo = 42              # foo is 42
# foo = foo - 2         # foo is 40
# foo = foo * 3         # foo is 120
# foo = foo + 5         # foo is 125
# foo = foo // 25       # foo is 5
# foo = foo / 2         # foo is 2.5
# foo = foo**3          # foo is 15.625
# print(foo)            # 15.625
